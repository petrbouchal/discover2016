This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r setup}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(knitr)
library(ggvis)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r results="asis"}
simpson <- read_csv('paradox_data.csv')

simpson2 <- simpson %>%
  filter(Ethnicity %in% c('Hispanic', 'White not Hispanic')) %>% 
  select(AgeCohort=`Age Cohort`, Ethnicity, Expenditures)

simpson2 %>% group_by(Ethnicity) %>%
  summarise(meanexp = sum(Expenditures), count=n()) %>% 
  mutate(percentage = count/sum(count)) %>%
  kable(digits=2)

simpson2 %>% group_by(Ethnicity, AgeCohort) %>% summarise(meanexp=mean(Expenditures)) %>%
  # spread(Ethnicity, meanexp) %>% 
  ggvis(~Ethnicity, ~meanexp)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
